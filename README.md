For additional information and documentation on FusionAuth refer to [https://fusionauth.io](https://fusionauth.io).


## Notice
This library is currently in development it is not yet available for public consumption.

> **WARNING**: This project is still in development, feel free to use, but it may not work. You may still feel free to open issues or submit PRs. 

## Upgrade Policy

This library is built automatically to keep track of the FusionAuth API, and may also receive updates with bug fixes, security patches, tests, code samples, or documentation changes.

These releases may also update dependencies, language engines, and operating systems, as we\'ll follow the deprecation and sunsetting policies of the underlying technologies that it uses.

This means that after a dependency (e.g. language, framework, or operating system) is deprecated by its maintainer, this library will also be deprecated by us, and will eventually be updated to use a newer version.
